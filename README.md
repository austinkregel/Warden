# What is this package?
This package was created to help decrease the time it takes to build a project
which needs to create, delete, and edit the project's [Laravel Model](http://laravel.com/docs/master/eloquent)s.

# Warden?
The project is named Warden because much like a prison warden, it can bring in an inmate (create a new item), take out an inmate (delete an item), or make changes to what the inmate can do
(edit an item). By no means is it limited to just a User's model. It (so far) can work an any model.

# How can I install this package?
Take a look at [our documentation](https://github.com/austinkregel/warden/blob/master/docs/readme.md)
